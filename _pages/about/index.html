<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I’m <strong>Bobae</strong>, an <em>aspiring computer graphics researcher</em> with a strong foundation in <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>generative AI</strong>. My academic focus has been on image and video synthesis, with a particular interest in face reenactment. I’ve explored and benchmarked generative models such as <strong>GANs</strong>, <strong>diffusion models</strong>, and <strong>VAEs</strong> to better understand their strengths and trade-offs.</p> <p>I recently completed my master’s at Concordia University, where I had the opportunity to work with <em>Professors Sudhir Mudur and Tiberiu Popa</em> in the <strong>3D Graphics Lab</strong>. There, I contributed to the development of a <strong>visual dubbing pipeline</strong>, centered around a StyleGAN-inspired autoencoder and state-of-the-art facial synthesis techniques.</p> <p>I’m especially drawn to the intersection of <strong>computer graphics</strong>, <strong>vision</strong>, and <strong>generative AI</strong>, from 3D reconstruction to realistic video synthesis. I’m always excited to collaborate on thoughtful and creative research.</p> <p>When I’m not working, I enjoy traveling, picnics, and doing sports. Feel free to reach out! I’m always open to new connections and conversations.</p> </body></html>
