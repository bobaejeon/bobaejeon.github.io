I'm **Bobae**, an *aspiring computer graphics researcher* with a strong foundation in **computer vision** and **generative AI**. My academic focus has been on image and video synthesis, with a particular interest in face reenactment. I’ve explored and benchmarked generative models such as **GANs**, **diffusion models**, and **VAEs** to better understand their strengths and trade-offs.

I recently completed my master's at Concordia University, where I had the opportunity to work with *Professors Sudhir Mudur and Tiberiu Popa* in the **3D Graphics Lab**. There, I contributed to the development of a **visual dubbing pipeline**, centered around a StyleGAN-inspired autoencoder and state-of-the-art facial synthesis techniques.

I'm especially drawn to the intersection of **computer graphics**, **vision**, and **generative AI**, from 3D reconstruction to realistic video synthesis. I’m always excited to collaborate on thoughtful and creative research.

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, picnics, and doing sports. Feel free to reach out! I’m always open to new connections and conversations.
